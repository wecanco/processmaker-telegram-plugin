$user->notify(new TaskNotification($task, [
    'complete' => '‚úÖ Complete',

## Security Considerations
- Always use HTTPS for webhooks
- Regularly rotate bot tokens
- Implement IP whitelisting for webhook endpoints
- Validate all incoming Telegram updates

## Troubleshooting
**Webhook not working:**
- Verify SSL certificate is valid
- Check bot token is correct
- Ensure the webhook URL is accessible

**Notifications not arriving:**
- Confirm user has connected Telegram account
- Check queue workers are running
- Verify Telegram chat ID is stored correctly
